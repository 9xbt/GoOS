# Contributing
All Contributions should be made in the form of a Pull Request
(unless Owen2k6 added you as a collaborator)

Your Pull request will require Owen to review and approve it before merging into the code.

Do not mess up anything Visual Studio (if you don't use Rider) does. keep the directory similar for god's sake!

## Pull Request guidelines:
- All changes must be presented
- A video must be attached showing this code working in a VM
   - If anything is missed, the PR will be denied. 
- Code must be reviewed by either Owen2k6 or other developers "and Owen2k6" before this PR is merged in fully.
